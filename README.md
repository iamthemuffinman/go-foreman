# go-katello
Go library for accessing the Katello/Foreman API.

The general design and implementation of this comes from the [go-github](https://github.com/google/go-github) library from Google.

## Status
There's still a LOT to do. I have a need for this at my current job and I'm sharing it here in hopes that someone else has the same need.
