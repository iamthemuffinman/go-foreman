# go-foreman
Go library for accessing the Foreman API: https://theforeman.org/.

The general design and implementation (and some code) of this comes from the [go-github](https://github.com/google/go-github) library from Google (shout out to Will Norris!).

## Status
There's still a LOT to do. Consider this alpha status.

## Can I help?
Of course! You can help by filing issues or PR's. [Here](https://theforeman.org/api/1.13/index.html) are the API docs for Foreman.
